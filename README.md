# Various Lua scripts for Assetto Corsa Server Manager

This repo contains scripts which might be in use, under development, or not, or anything really.

They're intended for use with ACSM which you can find via https://wiki.emperorservers.com/assetto-corsa-server-manager. 

Please note, there is an open source version at https://github.com/JustaPenguin/assetto-server-manager but this code has only really been used and maybe tested with ACSM v2.x.

## No support is offered for these scripts.

The best support for anything ACSM-related is the [Emperor Servers Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/6DGKJzB).

## No warranty is provided, or implied.

## Yes the license file is real.
